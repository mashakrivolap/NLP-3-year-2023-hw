      "After decades of good experiences at Nello under Mr. Balan's prior ownership, Nello's should be renamed \"Hell No\". Party of 3 well dressed women: the wait captain seemed annoyed we wanted to linger over cocktails before ordering, was miffed we weren't interested in the pricey...truffle options, and argued with the table's host about the calamari dish that she ordered which seemed to arrive incorrect according to the customer. Wait captain aggressively propped an open menu in front of her and in a loud voice berated the customer about what she had ordered suggesting she didn't know what she was talking about. Host, in turn, dubbed wait captain \"Rude\" and \"Abrupt\" in a voice loud enough he got the message.  Said Captain stalked off and disappeared until he presented the billing machine tableside to the host and then stood there glaring not letting go of the machine. The meal and experience were ruined by his poor demeanor. Note to staff: Customers are the reason a restaurant exists!  Entire horrible experience squarely the fault of Nello personnel who are seemingly bent on upselling, rushing the diners, and steering menu choices for $$$. Food was, in a word, \"Gross\".  Wine prices are revoltingly high. Ordinary Sta. Margherita Pinot Grigio is $130 per bottle and $29 per glass, which represents roughly a nine fold mark-up. Nello's has sunk to its lowest--a truly terrible experience you cannot afford to endure, in more ways than just the beating your wallet will take - undeservedly. However, if you like to sit down for a high priced, rushed dinner and be abused by surly, cocky waitstaff, Nello's is for you.  For us it will be \"Hell No\" Nello.More\n",
